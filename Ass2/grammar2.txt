# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
#
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)

#    Prep = preposition
#    Adj = adjective
#    Adv = adverb
#    Cc = coordinator

# New rules
# We try to construct sentences with an NP the leads to a VP, but one that more
# or less terminates immediately, or at least after very few conjunctions.
# In addition, we added different types of nouns, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions
# and complementizers to create more legal grammar.
