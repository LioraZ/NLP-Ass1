# Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
#
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)

# New rules
# We try to construct sentences with an NP the leads to a VP, but one that more
# or less terminates immediately, or at least after very few conjunctions.
# In addition, we added different types of nouns, verbs, adverbs, conjunctions
# and complementizers to create more legal grammar.

# A vs An rules
# We added the postfix's "A" and "An" to the determiner terminal, describing
# the determiners "a" and "an", and "V" and "C" to symbolize if the word starts
# with a vowel or with a consonant, and give it the appropriate determiner.

# Tenses rules
# We added VTenses to create sentences using special tenses, each of the VTenses
# rules, led to a different type of the following tenses: : simple, perfect,
# progressive and perfect + progressive. Each of the terminals in those rules
# symbolize the different structure of each of the tenses types. Verbs of types
# were added including VIS (is like verbs such as was), VHave(have like verbs
# such as had) etc.

# Grammar 5 - Quote rules

1	THOUGHT and NP FEEL
1	THOUGHT and NP that VP FEEL

# Grammar 5 - Quote terminals
# We added verbs with meaning to them such as feelings or thought, and added
# appropriate verbs describing these, so we will be able to insert them into
# quotes.
